This github repo is for vilota's technical assessment
* As all projects will be done via notebook style, markdowns clearly show the usage of the file as well as the ability of the file to run.

Project #1: Software Engineering - Geometry & Visualization (by 17th March)

Part 1: This project requires the learner to grasp the concept of basis transformation and homogeneous transformations. In the case of the notebook, the two frames would be the world frame and the camera frame. With the use of spatial math package, we are able to localise the position of the camera in the world frame.

Part 2: This project requires the learner to understand plotting of point clouds and line sets in order to make a wireframe of an object. After doing so, the learner is required to animate the object in any way to simulate realistic movement of the object. In this notebook, the wireframe camera is simulated to be circling around the center (0,0,0). Future work would involve rotating the camera to view the location (0,0,0) at all phases.

Project #2: Analytical - Fisheye Camera Model (by 24th March)


Project #3: Problem Solving - Symforce (by 24th March)
